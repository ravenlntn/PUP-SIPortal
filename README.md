# PUP-SIPortal

PUP-SIPortal provides students information for our professors and class presidents, it is a beta system for our final exam in Web Programming by using PHP DataBase. It is built specially for the professors who are having a hard time searching for students data through their files or messaging the class president. This system works in two ways: 

1. The ADMIN Server: This provides either the class president or assigned admin for the students information by updating, creating, and deleting. 
2. The CLIENT Server: This provides for the professor or any user to only view the students' data for convenient purposes. 

**This system still lacks of content and need room for further improvements.**
